This repository contains my final work of the Computer Science Degree in the UGR.

In the Android part there is the "main" folder of the Android Studio application. To use it just create a new Android Studio project and make use of the code of the Activities I created.

In the Unreal Engine part there is all the classes and blueprints I created for the project. To use them just put them inside the Content folder and Source folder of an Unreal Engine project called "ServerTCP3".

Further information about the project development and how to use it will be provided in the PDF called "Memoria.pdf".
